This folder contains code for processing: 
At the moment the code runs the visual on processing and displays random balls on an imaginary board and lights up the ellipses.
This code is pretty much completely done and there is very minimal work needed to be done.
You may need to debug the processing code, but that is very unlikely.
-BeatBearing_Processing_v04.pde is the driving class for the whole code it drives the TTime class and the TBearing class.
-TTime controls the time of the processing code (this should not need to be changed).
-TBearing controls the visuals for the processing files.
-setGrid allows you to set each you grid to the desiered length.
-serialInput is the class that is supposed to display the visuals and read the ball location from the arduino as they are passed along to
processing and then it flashes where the balls location are.

# BeatBearing
Hi  
   
Three or four or five different programs are being run in this first attempt to create software for the beat bearing.

They are in three folders: arduino, processing and python.

The actual music/drum beats are being performed by a python synthesizer called csoundQt when it is a standalone gui. When it is a processing package or module it is called ctcsound. 

Right now there is a python (tested in 3.5) program that will execute a drumMachine test. Look in the python folder.

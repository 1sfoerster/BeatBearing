# BeatBearing
Hello  
   
They are in three folders: arduino, processing and python.

All the code pieces work. They have all worked together. 

The current breaking point is the arduino reading mux output correctly. See the arduino folder. 

Processing controls the monitor underneath the beat bearing board.

Python is currently in two pieces. Once listens successfully and in parallel to the arduino. The second bit of python code plays some really bad drum beats. Next step advice is in the python folder. The actual music/drum beats are being performed by a python synthesizer called csoundQt when it is a standalone gui. When standalone it uses a package called ctcsound. Install csoundQt and enthought canopy to look at the details in the python folder.

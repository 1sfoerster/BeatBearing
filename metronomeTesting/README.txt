# metronomeTesting
This arduino sketch simulates 4 row, 8 column, 32 position beat bearing board with random data.  

The data is randomized atthe beginning, 1/3 through the sweep and 2/3 through the sweep to test all the balls.  
  
Code that actually queries the two 16 bnit buxes and parces the output into a 32 bit array and sends the data has not been integrated into this yet.
